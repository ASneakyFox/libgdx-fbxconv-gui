Features styles of most common **Scene2D** widgets. Citing the author:

> Relive the silver age of computing when operating systems were real operating systems! This skin has been inspired by the Windows XP OS. I created the images myself and they are not ripped from the source. This could be used as a fake desktop in a computer simulation or the base for something more advanced.
