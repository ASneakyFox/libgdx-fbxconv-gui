# VisUI skin

This is the default flat design skin provided by the [VisUI](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-editor/wiki/VisUI) library. It supports every widget style from regular **Scene2D**, as well as custom **VisUI** actor styles. Comes in **two** sizes. Raw assets include *TTF* and *SVG* files.

If you really want to use this skin without **VisUI** extension, delete the additional styles of widgets absent in vanilla **Scene2D** and it should *just work*.

The latest skin version is always shipped with the [VisUI library](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-editor/tree/master/ui). You can find raw assets [here](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-editor/tree/master/ui/assets-raw). This repository might not be up-to-date.

### Extras

Additional, modified skins for **VisUI** are available in the [`vis-ui-contrib` repository](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-ui-contrib).

### License

Seems to be the same as the one used by [related libraries](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-editor), which basically matches **LibGDX** license.
