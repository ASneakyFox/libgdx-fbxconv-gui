<p>Crossplatform Gui Wrapper for fbx-conv written in Java. Meant to be small and lightweight.</p>

<p>Also serves as a model preview utility.</p>

<p>Can convert files individually or in a batch.</p>

<p>You can download a precompiled jar using the link on the right</p>

<h2>
<a id="basic-usage" class="anchor" href="#basic-usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic Usage</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>You need Java 7 installed to use this software. It might work with Java 8, havent tried.</p></li>
<li><p>Download the command line tool fbx-conv from: <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/fbx-conv">https://github.com/libgdx/fbx-conv</a>. extract the zip to your favorite folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Download fbxconv-gui.jar from the releases section ( <a href="https://github.com/ASneakyFox/libgdx-fbxconv-gui/releases">https://github.com/ASneakyFox/libgdx-fbxconv-gui/releases</a> ) and put it in the same folder with fbx-conv</p></li>
<li><p>(linux/mac only: be sure you also copy the .dylib and .so files to /usr/lib, windows users dont need to do this)</p></li>
<li><p>run fbxconv-gui.jar by double click on it to run it.</p></li>
<li><p>The first thing you need to do is set the path to your copy of fbx-conv. Click the Browse button in the Configuration tab and search for it.</p></li>
<li><p>You should be good to go. Program should be straight forward, read the below sections for more details.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: fbxconv-gui was tested with the latest release version of fbx-conv available on 10/30/2014, other versions may or may not work</p>

<p>If youre having problems check to make sure you can use the command line tool by itself, check its readme file on its github page for more info.</p>

<a id="previewing-3d-models" class="anchor" href="#previewing-3d-models" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Previewing 3D Models</h2>

<p>Use the file list on the left to search for 3d models to preview (supports .obj, .fbx, .dae, .g3db, .g3dj)</p>

<p>Models in the format of .obj, .fbx, or .dae will be converted to .g3dj for previewing with your specified Configuration options on the bottom left, .g3dj and .g3db files do not need to be converted and will be viewed directly.</p>

<p>If you have "Automatic Preview" checked then model files will automatically be shown when you select them, otherwise you need to press the "Preview" button.</p>

<p>If you make change in the Configuration tab you need to press "Preview" again to see the changes, even if Automatic Preview is turned on.</p>

<p>Previeiwng files is not the same as converting. You must push the "Convert" button in the Configuration tab to convert and save the current file.</p>

<h2>
<a id="single-file-and-batch-convert" class="anchor" href="#single-file-and-batch-convert" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Single File and Batch Convert</h2>

<p>When you drag and drop a directory to the window, it will do a batch convert. (a dialog will appear)</p>

<p>It will ask you what extension to use for the "source" file (eg .fbx). It will only convert files with that extension. The new file will have the same name and be in the same directory, but with the new extension (either g3db or g3dj).</p>

<p>If you drag and drop a single file it will automatically convert it without a dialog, unless you have that option deselected on the left toolbox, then it will just preview it.</p>
